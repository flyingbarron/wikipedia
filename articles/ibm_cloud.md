## Services

> A simplified, less exhaustive list.

As of 2021, IBM Cloud contains more than [130 services](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog) including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, machine learning, and developer tools. The most popular include the IBM Cloud Kubernetes service (IKS), Red Hat OpenShift (ROKS), Watson Assistant, Watson Studio, Cloud Object Storage, and Cloudant.

## History

### 2.1 Initial launch of Bluemix (2013-2016)

> For additional information see the article on [Bluemix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluemix)

In June 2013, IBM acquired SoftLayer, a public cloud platform, to serve as the foundation for its IaaS offering.[4][5] In July 2014, IBM introduced Bluemix. Bluemix was based on the open source Cloud Foundry project and ran on SoftLayer infrastructure.[6] In February 2016, IBM launched a Function as a Service (FaaS) system, or Serverless computing offering, that is built using open source[14] from the Apache OpenWhisk incubator project largely credited[15] to IBM for seeding. This system, equivalent to Amazon Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions, Oracle Cloud Fn or Google Cloud Functions, allows calling of a specific function in response to an event without requiring any resource management from the developer.[16] [https://thenewstack.io/ibm-launches-bluemix-openwhisk-event-driven-program-service/]. In October 2016, IBM rolled the SoftLayer brand under its Bluemix brand of PaaS offerings.

### 2.2	Re-brand to IBM Cloud (2017â€“Present)

In May 2017 IBM released Kubernetes support as the IBM Cloud Container Service, later renamed to the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS). [https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/kubernetes-now-available-ibm-bluemix-container-service]. IKS was built using the open source Kubernetes project. This system, equivalent to Amazon Web Services EKS, Microsoft Azure AKS, or Google Cloud GKE, aims to provide a platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts. In In October 2017, IBM announced that they would rebrand their cloud as IBM Cloud brand, merging all components, thus retiring the Bluemix and Softlayer brands. [1][12] In March 2018, IBM launched an industry first managed Kubernetes service on bare metal. [https://www.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-computing/2018/03/14/managed-kubernetes-bare-metal]. In August 2019, 3 weeks after the close of Red Hat acquisition, IBM launched a managed Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud. [https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/red-hat-openshift-on-ibm-cloud]. In March 2021, IBM launched Cloud Satellite, a service available in any environment (any cloud, on premises or at the edge).

## Customer base

- In 2019, it has been reported that IBM has once again partnered with the [[United_States_Tennis_Association|United States Tennis Association (USTA)]] and they're using new AI-powered tools during the [[US_Open_(tennis)|US Open]] to deliver AI-generated highlights, real-time stats and match analysis, as well as an onsite experience center where attendees can experience AI in action.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-ibm-is-delivering-ai-generated-highlights-at-the-us-open/ |title=How IBM is delivering AI-generated highlights at the US Open |date=September 8, 2019 | access-date=November 26, 2021}}</ref>

## Significant service outages

* On June 9, 2020, IBM Cloud suffered a major outage that hit 80 data centres globally for well over three hours. [https://techmonitor.ai/techonology/cloud/ibm-cloud-outage]. An investigation determined that an external network provider flooded the IBM Cloud network with incorrect routing, resulting in severe congestion of traffic and impacted IBM Cloud services and data centres. [https://www.itproportal.com/news/massive-ibm-cloud-outage-caused-by-bgp-hijacking/]

## Availability and topology

IBM Cloud is comprised of 60 data centers available in 19 countries on 6 continents. [https://www.ibm.com/cloud/data-centers/]. IBM Cloud data centers in Americas (Dallas, Houston, Mexico, Montreal, San Jose, Sao Paulo, Toronto, and Washington DC), Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Milan, Oslo, and Paris), and Asia Pacific (Chennai, Hong Kong, Osaka, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo).

## Environmental impact

In 2021, IBM announced it would [achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-02-16-IBM-Commits-To-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-By-2030). To achieve its net zero goal IBM will:

* Reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 65% by 2025 against base year 2010.
* Procure 75% of the electricity it consumes worldwide from renewable sources by 2025, and 90% by 2030.
* Use feasible technologies, such as carbon capture (in or by 2030) to remove emissions in an amount which equals or exceeds the level of IBM's residual emissions.
